# Text-Detection-and-Classification-in-Natural-Images using MSER

MSER is based on the idea of taking regions which stay nearly the same through a wide range of thresholds.
Apply a series of thresholds – one for each grayscale level. 
• Threshold the image at each level to create a series of black and white images. 
• One extreme will be all white, the other all black.
